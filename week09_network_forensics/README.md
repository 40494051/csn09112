## Network Forensics
The key objectives of this chapter are:

* Understand some of the methodologies used in network forensics.
* Provide an in-depth understanding of the key network protocols, including IP, TCP, ARP, ICMP, DNS, Application Layer protocols, and so on.
* Define a range of audit sources for network activity.
