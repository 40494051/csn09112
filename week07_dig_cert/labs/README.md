# Ciphers and Digital Certificates

The aim of this lab is to give an introduction to ciphers, basic encoding/decoding techniques and frequency analysis, as to provide some fundamental understanding. Activities include decoding a range of ciphers and simple calculations. 

4 hours (two supervised hours in the lab, and two additional unsupervised hours).

## Learning activities:
At the end of this lab, you should understand:

•	How to decode a range of ciphers.
•	How to recognise certain encodings, such as Base-64, hex, and binary.
•	How to write a Python script to crack PFX certificates. The PKCS#12 (PFX or P12) format is the binary format in which certificates are stored on a server. They are protected by a password and contain the public and private key (the key pair).
•	How to perform bitwise calculations.
•	How to perform frequency analysis.
