VMRC 11.x can be forced to run in legacy mode, which should work with current IS firewall configuration. Iâ€™d say this is probably the best workaround to suggest:
Configure VMware Remote Console 11.x to use the legacy connection mode. To do so, open the VMware preferences file on the host machine and add the following parameters:

```
pref.preferWebMKS = "FALSE"
pref.preferWebRemoteDevice = "FALSE"
```

The preferences file can be found in the following location:

* Windows: %APPDATA%\VMware\preferences.ini
* macOS (standard install): ~/Library/Preferences/VMware Remote Console/preferences
* macOS (App Store install):~/Library/Containers/com.vmware.vmrc/Data/Library/Preferences/VMware Remote Console/preferences
* Linux: ~/.vmware/preferences
